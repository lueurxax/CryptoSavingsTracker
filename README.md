   - Generate your API key

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CryptoSavingsTracker.git
   cd CryptoSavingsTracker
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open CryptoSavingsTracker.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Configure your API key:
   - Copy `Config.example.plist` to `Config.plist`
   - Open `Config.plist` and replace `YOUR_COINGECKO_API_KEY` with your actual API key
   - Drag `Config.plist` into your Xcode project to include it in the app bundle

4. Update the bundle identifier:
   - Select the project in Xcode
   - Update the bundle identifier to your own (e.g., `com.yourname.CryptoSavingsTracker`)

5. Build and run:
   - Select your target device/simulator
   - Press `Cmd+R` to build and run

## Usage

### Creating Your First Goal

1. Launch the app and tap "Add New Goal"
2. Enter a goal name (e.g., "Vacation Fund")
3. Select your target currency (e.g., "USD")
4. Set your target amount (e.g., $5000)
5. Choose a deadline date
6. Tap "Save"

### Adding Cryptocurrency Assets

1. Select your goal from the main list
2. Tap "Add Asset"
3. Choose a cryptocurrency (e.g., "BTC", "ETH")
4. Tap "Save"

### Recording Transactions

1. In your goal detail view, find the asset
2. Tap on the asset row
3. Tap "Add Transaction"
4. Enter the amount you've saved in that cryptocurrency
5. Tap "Save"

The app will automatically calculate your progress by converting all assets to your goal's target currency using real-time exchange rates.

## Architecture

The app follows modern SwiftUI best practices:

- **SwiftData**: Core Data replacement for local persistence
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Async/Await**: Modern concurrency for API calls
- **Portfolio-based Design**: Multiple assets per goal for diversified savings

### Data Model

```
Goal (1) ‚Üí Assets (many) ‚Üí Transactions (many)
```

- **Goals**: Top-level savings targets with currency and amount
- **Assets**: Individual cryptocurrencies within a goal
- **Transactions**: Deposit records for each asset

## Platform Support

The app is designed to work seamlessly across Apple platforms:

### iOS
- Native navigation with toolbar controls
- Optimized for iPhone and iPad
- Keyboard shortcuts for forms

### macOS
- Pure SwiftUI implementation avoiding AppKit controls
- Graphical date pickers for better compatibility
- Proper window sizing and keyboard navigation

### visionOS
- Future-ready for spatial computing
- Adaptive layouts for immersive experiences

## API Integration

### CoinGecko API

The app integrates with CoinGecko's public API for:
- **Supported Currencies**: `/api/v3/simple/supported_vs_currencies`
- **Price Data**: `/api/v3/simple/price`

All API calls include:
- 5-minute caching for performance
- Persistent cache across app restarts
- Error handling and offline support
