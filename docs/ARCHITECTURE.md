## Platform Architecture

### Platform Abstraction Strategy

The app uses **conditional platform abstraction** with a hybrid approach:

```swift
// Primary abstraction through ContentView platform switching
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.platformCapabilities) private var platform
    
    var body: some View {
        Group {
            switch platform.navigationStyle {
            case .stack: iOSContentView()
            case .splitView: macOSContentView()
            case .tabs: // Future implementation
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Platform Capabilities System

Location: `/CryptoSavingsTracker/Utilities/PlatformCapabilities.swift`

```swift
enum NavigationStylePreference {
    case stack     // iOS compact
    case splitView // macOS, iPad
    case tabs      // Future: tvOS, watchOS
}
```

## View Component Map

### 🎯 **Goal Display Components** *(Critical for Maintainability)*

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: When modifying goal display logic, you must update ALL these components

| Platform | Component | File Location | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **iOS** | `GoalRowView` | `/Views/GoalsListView.swift` | Main iOS goal list rows |
| **macOS** | `GoalSidebarRow` | `/Views/Components/GoalsSidebarView.swift` | macOS sidebar goal entries |
| **Shared** | `GoalRowView` (alt) | `/Views/ContentView.swift` (GoalsList) | Alternative iOS implementation |
| **Shared** | `GoalRowView` (alt) | `/Views/Goals/GoalsListContainer.swift` | iOS container variant |

#### 🔧 **Goal Component Responsibilities**

```swift
// Common functionality across ALL goal display components:
// ✅ Emoji display (with SF Symbol fallback)
// ✅ Progress bar with currency-converted values
// ✅ Status badges (Achieved, On Track, Behind)
// ✅ Days remaining with urgency indicators
// ✅ Description preview (if available)
// ✅ Accessibility support
```

### 📊 **Progress Calculation Architecture**

> **🎯 KEY INSIGHT**: All goal lists must use `GoalCalculationService` for accurate progress

```swift
// ❌ DEPRECATED - Returns 0% fallback values
let progress = await goal.getProgress()

// ✅ CORRECT - Returns currency-converted progress
let progress = await GoalCalculationService.getProgress(for: goal)
```

**Service Location**: `/Services/GoalCalculationService.swift`
**Purpose**: Centralizes currency conversion and progress calculation logic

---

## Goal List Implementation Guide

### Finding Goal List Components

When you need to modify goal display logic:

1. **iOS Primary**: Look in `GoalsListView.swift` for `GoalRowView`
2. **macOS Primary**: Look in `GoalsSidebarView.swift` for `GoalSidebarRow`
3. **Alternative implementations**: Search for `GoalRowView` usage across codebase
4. **Progress calculation**: Always use `GoalCalculationService` for currency conversion

### Component Unification Status

| Status | Component | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| ✅ **Unified (Phase 1)** | Goal row display logic | `UnifiedGoalRowView` with `GoalRowViewModel` |
| ✅ **Unified** | Progress calculation | Uses GoalCalculationService |
| ✅ **Unified** | Emoji/description data | Shared Goal model properties |
| ✅ **Enhanced (Phase 2)** | Platform abstraction | Enhanced `PlatformCapabilities` with modal styles, haptics, window management |

## Service Layer Architecture

### Calculation Services

```
Services/
├── AllocationService.swift           ← **Manages asset allocations to goals (NEW)**
├── GoalCalculationService.swift      ← **Allocation-aware progress calculation**
├── ExchangeRateService.swift         ← Currency conversion
├── BalanceService.swift              ← Blockchain balance fetching (DI)
├── TransactionService.swift          ← Transaction history fetching (DI)
├── TatumService.swift                ← Blockchain data wrapper (DI)
├── MonthlyPlanningService.swift      ← Required monthly calculations
└── FlexAdjustmentService.swift       ← Payment flexibility
```

### Service Responsibilities

| Service | Purpose | Initialization | Used By |
|---------|---------|---------------|---------|
| `AllocationService` | Manages the percentage-based allocation of assets to goals. | DI (ModelContext) | Asset & Goal management views |
| `GoalCalculationService` | Calculates goal progress based on asset allocations and currency conversion. | Singleton | **ALL goal display components** |
| `ExchangeRateService` | Real-time exchange rates | Singleton | Goal calculations, displays |
| `BalanceService` | On-chain balance fetching | DI (TatumClient, ChainService) | Asset management, calculations |
| `TransactionService` | Transaction history | DI (TatumClient, ChainService) | Transaction views |
| `TatumService` | Blockchain API wrapper | DI (TatumClient, ChainService) | Views, ViewModels |
| `MonthlyPlanningService` | Required payment calculations | DI (ExchangeRateService) | Planning views, widgets |

### Dependency Injection Architecture

```swift
// Services now use dependency injection instead of singletons
let balanceService = BalanceService(
    client: TatumClient.shared,
    chainService: ChainService.shared
)

// DIContainer manages service creation with error recovery
DIContainer.shared.coinGeckoService     // Returns service or fallback
DIContainer.shared.exchangeRateService  // Automatic error handling
DIContainer.shared.makeDashboardViewModel() // ViewModel factory with injected deps
```

#### ViewModel Factories (Usage)

```swift
// Prefer DI-provided factories over direct initializers
@StateObject private var viewModel = DIContainer.shared.makeDashboardViewModel()

// DashboardViewModel receives:
// - ExchangeRateServiceProtocol
// - BalanceServiceProtocol
// - TransactionServiceProtocol
// - GoalCalculationServiceProtocol
```

> Do not construct services inside ViewModels. Inject via `DIContainer` to improve testability and enable error recovery/fallbacks.

### Error Recovery Strategy

The `DIContainer` implements a robust error recovery pattern:

```swift
// Automatic fallback when service creation fails
var coinGeckoService: CoinGeckoService {
    do {
        let service = try createCoinGeckoService()
        return service
    } catch {
        AppLog.error("Failed to create service: \(error)")
        return createMockCoinGeckoService()  // Fallback service
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Circular dependency detection
- Service validation after initialization
- Health check capabilities
- Automatic retry for failed services
- Fallback/mock services for critical functionality

### API Rate Limiting Architecture

```
Utilities/
├── RateLimiter.swift         ← Per-key rate limiting
├── StartupThrottler.swift    ← Prevents startup API spam
└── BalanceCacheManager.swift ← Persistent cache with fallback
```

**Rate Limiting Strategy:**
1. **StartupThrottler**: 3-second delay after app startup
2. **RateLimiter**: 5-second cooldown per unique request key
3. **BalanceCacheManager**: 30-minute cache for balances, 2-hour for transactions
4. **Fallback Cache**: Returns stale data when rate limited

---

## Data Flow Patterns

### MVVM Implementation Status

The data model now uses a join model, `AssetAllocation`, to link Assets and Goals.

```
Models/
├── Goal.swift                    ← SwiftData persistence
├── Asset.swift                   ← SwiftData persistence
├── AssetAllocation.swift         ← **Links Assets and Goals (NEW)**
├── Transaction.swift             ← SwiftData persistence
└── ...

ViewModels/
├── GoalEditViewModel.swift           ← Goal editing logic
├── GoalViewModel.swift               ← Individual goal management
├── AssetViewModel.swift              ← Individual asset management
└── ...

Views/
├── GoalsListView.swift              ← iOS goal list
├── AssetAllocationView.swift        ← **Manages asset allocations (NEW)**
└── ...
```

### Change Detection Pattern

```swift
// SwiftData change detection pattern used throughout
@Published var goal: Goal
private let originalSnapshot: GoalSnapshot

func triggerChangeDetection() {
    updateDirtyState()
    validateWithDelay()
}
```

---

## File Organization

### Current Structure

├── Models/                   ← SwiftData models
├── ViewModels/              ← MVVM view models  
├── Views/
│   ├── Components/          ← Reusable UI components

└── Repositories/           ← Data access layer
```

### Platform-Specific Files

| Platform | Key Files | Navigation Pattern |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **iOS** | `iOSContentView.swift`, `GoalsListView.swift` | NavigationStack |
| **macOS** | `macOSContentView.swift`, `GoalsSidebarView.swift` | NavigationSplitView |
| **Shared** | `ContentView.swift`, Models, Services | Platform abstraction |

---

## Component Relationships

### Goal Display Dependency Graph

The data relationship between `Asset` and `Goal` is now mediated by the `AssetAllocation` model.

```
Goal Model ←── AssetAllocation ──→ Asset Model
    │                                    │
    └───────────┐                        │
                ↓                        ↓
    GoalCalculationService ←─────── ExchangeRateService
                │
                ↓
    UnifiedGoalRowView (Shared)
                ↓
    GoalsListView / GoalsSidebarView
                ↓
    ContentView (Platform Router)
```

### Critical Dependencies

1. **`GoalCalculationService`** → `AssetAllocation` (to determine how much of an asset contributes to a goal).
2. **All goal displays** → `GoalCalculationService` (for currency conversion and progress calculation).
3. **`AllocationService`** → `Asset`, `Goal`, `AssetAllocation` (to manage relationships).
4. **Platform views** → `PlatformCapabilities` (abstraction).

🎯 **Complete MVVM**: Move all business logic to ViewModels

---

## UI and Design Review

A UI and design review was conducted to identify areas for improvement. The following enhancements have been implemented:

*   **Improved Visual Hierarchy in `GoalDetailView`**: The font size of the section headers has been increased and more vertical spacing has been added between sections to improve readability.
*   **Enhanced `FlexAdjustmentSlider` Interactivity**: A live-updating label has been added to the slider to display the precise percentage as the user drags it.
*   **Simplified `MonthlyPlanningWidget` Design**: The design of the widget has been simplified to focus on the most critical information and to use a more spacious layout.
*   **Incorporated More Animations and Transitions**: A smooth cross-fade transition has been added when switching between the "Details" and "Dashboard" tabs in the `DetailContainerView`.

# Architecture Review

## 1. Executive Summary

The application architecture is modern, robust, and well-suited for a cross-platform SwiftUI application. It effectively utilizes key design patterns like **MVVM, Service Layer, Repository, and Coordinator**, which provides a clear and scalable separation of concerns. The adoption of modern Apple technologies, including **SwiftUI, SwiftData, and Combine**, is commendable.

The architecture's primary strengths are its modularity, clear data flow, and thoughtful approach to dependency management through the `DIContainer`. The recent refactoring to support the "Asset Splitting" feature has been integrated cleanly, demonstrating the architecture's flexibility.

The key recommendations focus on enforcing stricter adherence to the established Dependency Injection (DI) pattern within the ViewModels to further improve testability and maintainability.

---

## 2. Architectural Pattern Analysis

The application correctly implements several key architectural patterns:

*   **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM):** There is a clear separation between Views (UI), ViewModels (UI logic and state), and Models (data). This is well-executed, with Views remaining lightweight and ViewModels handling user interactions and data preparation.

*   **Service Layer:** Business logic is correctly encapsulated in dedicated services (e.g., `MonthlyPlanningService`, `AllocationService`, `BalanceService`). This makes the logic reusable and independent of the UI.

*   **Repository Pattern:** The use of `GoalRepository` and `AssetRepository` abstracts the data source (SwiftData) from the services that consume the data. This is excellent practice and makes the application more resilient to future changes in the persistence layer.

*   **Dependency Injection (DI) & `DIContainer`:** The `DIContainer` acts as a centralized point for creating and accessing services. This is a major strength, as it decouples components and simplifies dependency management. However, as noted below, its use is not yet consistent across all ViewModels.

*   **Coordinator Pattern:** The `AppCoordinator` centralizes navigation logic, which is a scalable approach for managing complex navigation flows, especially in a multi-platform app.

---

## 3. Key Strengths

1.  **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The distinct layers (View, ViewModel, Service, Repository, Model) make the codebase easy to navigate, understand, and maintain.
2.  **Testability:** The use of protocols for services (`BalanceServiceProtocol`, etc.) and the DI container are excellent architectural choices that make the codebase highly testable. Mocking dependencies for unit tests is straightforward.
3.  **Scalability:** The current architecture can easily accommodate new features. The recent addition of the `AssetAllocation` model and `AllocationService` was integrated without requiring a fundamental redesign, proving the architecture's flexibility.
4.  **Modern Technology Stack:** The use of SwiftUI, SwiftData, and modern concurrency (`async/await`) makes the app performant and future-proof.
5.  **Platform Abstraction:** The `PlatformCapabilities` system provides a solid foundation for managing platform-specific UI and logic, reducing the need for `#if os()` directives in the view layer.

---

## 4. Architectural Refinements Implemented

Following the initial review, several key architectural refinements have been successfully implemented, strengthening the codebase and improving adherence to best practices.

### 4.1. Dependency Injection in ViewModels

*   **Action Taken:** ViewModels such as `DashboardViewModel` have been refactored to receive their service dependencies via an initializer, which is called from a factory method in the `DIContainer`.
*   **Outcome:** This change has decoupled ViewModels from concrete service implementations, significantly improving testability and ensuring all services are managed centrally.

### 4.2. Singleton Conversion for Services

*   **Action Taken:** The `GoalCalculationService`, which previously used static methods, has been refactored into an injectable, protocol-based service managed by the `DIContainer`.
*   **Outcome:** This allows `GoalCalculationService` to be easily mocked in unit tests, completing the transition to a fully testable service layer.

### 4.3. Code Consolidation

*   **Action Taken:** Several redundant views related to asset allocation (`AssetAllocationView`, `TestAllocationView`) and an older dashboard (`SimpleDashboardView`) were removed.
*   **Outcome:** The codebase is now leaner, with a single source of truth for the allocation UI (`AssetSharingView`), which reduces maintenance and improves clarity.

---

## 5. Code Duplication and Dead Code Analysis

An analysis of the codebase was performed to identify areas of code duplication and unused (dead) code.

### 5.1. Findings

*   **Code Duplication:** Multiple views (`AssetAllocationView`, `AssetSharingView`, `TestAllocationView`) were created to handle asset allocation management. Their functionality was largely identical, leading to duplicated UI code and logic.
*   **Dead Code:** The `SimpleDashboardView.swift` file was identified as being superseded by the more robust and feature-rich `DashboardView.swift` and its components.

### 5.2. Actions Taken

Based on the review, the following cleanup actions were performed:

*   **Consolidation:** The functionality of the various allocation views was consolidated into a single, reusable view: `AssetSharingView.swift`. The redundant files (`AssetAllocationView.swift`, `TestAllocationView.swift`) were deleted.
*   **Removal of Dead Code:** The unused `SimpleDashboardView.swift` file was deleted from the project.

### 5.3. Outcome

These changes have streamlined the codebase, reduced the maintenance overhead, and ensured a single source of truth for the asset allocation UI. The project is now leaner and easier to navigate.

---

## 6. Conclusion

The application is built on a solid and scalable architectural foundation. The existing patterns are well-chosen and have been implemented consistently following the latest refactoring.

By enforcing Dependency Injection and consolidating duplicated UI components, the architecture has been made even more robust and testable. These refinements ensure the application will be easy to maintain and extend as it continues to grow.
