# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Console Warnings and How to Fix Them

### üîá Haptic Feedback Warnings (iOS Simulator)

**Symptoms:**
```
CHHapticPattern.mm:487 +[CHHapticPattern patternForKey:error:]: Failed to read pattern library data
<_UIKBFeedbackGenerator: 0x...>: Error creating CHHapticPattern
```

**Cause:** iOS Simulator doesn't have full haptic feedback support, causing system components (like keyboard) to generate warnings when trying to provide haptic feedback.

**Impact:** ‚úÖ **Harmless** - These warnings:
- Don't affect app functionality
- Only appear in iOS Simulator (not on real devices)
- Are generated by system components, not your app
- Don't indicate any bugs in your code

**Solutions:**

#### Option 1: Ignore Them (Recommended)
These warnings are safe to ignore as they're system-level iOS Simulator limitations.

#### Option 2: Use Custom Haptic Manager
We've included a `HapticManager` utility that automatically disables haptics in simulator:

```swift
// Safe haptic feedback that won't generate warnings
HapticManager.shared.impact(.light)
HapticManager.shared.notification(.success)
HapticManager.shared.selection()

// SwiftUI integration
Button("Save") { }
    .successHaptic(on: saveSuccess)
```

#### Option 3: Filter Console Output
In Xcode, you can filter out these warnings:
1. Open Console in Xcode
2. Add filter: `-CHHapticPattern -UIKBFeedbackGenerator`
3. This will hide haptic-related warnings

### üî§ RTIInputSystemClient Warnings

**Symptoms:**
```
-[RTIInputSystemClient remoteTextInputSessionWithID:performInputOperation:] perform input operation requires a valid sessionID
```

**Cause:** iOS Simulator text input system handling differences from real devices.

**Impact:** ‚úÖ **Harmless** - This warning:
- Doesn't affect text input functionality
- Only appears in iOS Simulator
- Is a known iOS Simulator limitation

**Solution:** Safe to ignore - text input works normally despite the warning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tips

### Building in Xcode Beta
- Expect additional warnings from beta toolchain
- Most Metal/GPU warnings are cosmetic in beta
- Focus on functionality over warning count during development

### Clean Build Issues
If you encounter build issues:
1. **Clean Build Folder**: Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder (‚åò‚áßK)
2. **Clear DerivedData**: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
3. **Reset Simulator**: Device ‚Üí Erase All Content and Settings

### Performance in Simulator
- SwiftData operations may be slower in simulator
- Network requests have different timing than real devices
- Use real device testing for performance validation

## üöÄ Best Practices

### Console Management
- Filter out system warnings during development
- Focus on your app's log messages and errors
- Use `print()` with prefixes for easy filtering: `print("üîî MyApp: message")`

### Testing Strategy
1. **Simulator**: UI layout, basic functionality, debugging
2. **Real Device**: Performance, haptics, camera, notifications
3. **Multiple Devices**: Different screen sizes and capabilities

### Memory Management
- These warnings don't indicate memory leaks
- Use Instruments for actual memory profiling
- SwiftData handles most memory management automatically

## üìû Need More Help?

If you encounter warnings not covered here:
1. Check if they appear on real devices
2. Search Apple Developer Forums
3. File feedback with Apple if it's a framework issue

Remember: **Not all console output indicates problems** - focus on functionality over warning count!
