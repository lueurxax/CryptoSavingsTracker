## ðŸŽ¨ Screenshot Best Practices

   - "Vacation Savings" ($5,000 USD, 34% complete, 120 days left)

   - Ethereum (ETH): $1,200
   - Solana (SOL): $350
   ```

2. **Use round numbers** for better visual appeal
3. **Show progress** - avoid 0% or 100% goals
4. **Include dates** that make sense (future deadlines)

### Visual Quality
